Today marks the official launch of **Fresh**, an open and ever-evolving *Friendly Research Resources Hub* built by researchers, for researchers.
**Fresh** is designed to make every element required for scientific writing *immediately usable*:
from visualization methods, tables and algorithm pseudocode in LaTex format, to `.bib` reference sources, elegant phrasing, research tools, and academic insights.

{/* truncate */}

At its core, **Fresh** upholds the idea of being *Friendly*.
Every entry in the library ensures that it is:

1. A plug-and-play component for research writing;
2. Ready for quick replication and adaptation;
3. Accompanied by detailed input/output specifications and dependency notes;
4. Complete with verified reference links and `.bib` source code.

Each entry includes minimal reproducible examples and clear metadata, allowing you to copy, adapt, or extend them within minutes.
Fresh also curates domain-specific references, particularly in **Evaluatology**, **Artificial Intelligence**, **AI Benchmarking**, and **AI-Designed AI**, with ready-to-use `.bib` codes and source links for efficient citation and verification.

> #### Plug-n-Play Components 📦 
> Includes data visualization code, LaTeX table sources, and algorithm pseudocode, ready to copy or lightly modify for instant use.
>
> #### Quick Replication ⚡ 
> Each entry provides minimal examples, I/O formats, and dependency documentation, enabling fast replication and secondary modification.
> 
> #### Unified Reference 📚 
> Features paper metadata, titles, DOIs, and `.bib` codes supporting BibTeX/Biber compilation for quick citation.
> 
> #### Easy Access 🔍 
> All entries are clearly named and searchable through tags, keywords, and structured fields.

**Fresh** is more than just a component library for academic writing.
It also gathers everyday research assets like exploration tools, standalone scripts, reusable writing materials, and curated academic highlights.

> #### Tools and Scripts 🧰 
> Provides standalone and documented utilities for researchers, such as scripts for analyzing ICLR submission statistics from OpenReview.
> 
> #### Reusable Writing Assets ✍️ 
> A collection of refined expressions, caption templates, title structures, and stylistic inspirations for better academic writing.
> 
> #### Fresh News 🗞️ 
> Announces lab updates, repository additions, and research milestones in a concise and accessible format.

We envision **Fresh** as a collaborative camp for sharing research creativity.

Welcome to a new journey: **A Fresh Beginning**.
