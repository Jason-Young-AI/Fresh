### Interactive Dashboard üåê
An interactive HTML dashboard provides filtering, sorting, and keyword-specific exploration.
Open it directly in your browser to explore relationships between **abstracts**, **authors**, and **submission fields**.

{/* [Open the Dashboard (ICLR 2026)](./ios/ICLR-2026-Submissions-Online.html) */}
```mdx-code-block
import HTMLViewer from '@site/src/components/Miscs/HTMLViewer';
import DashboardURL from './ios/ICLR-2026-Submissions-Online.html';

<HTMLViewer src={DashboardURL} height={920} title="ICLR 2026 Dashboard" />
```

### Fetched CSV üßæ

**[ICLR-2026-Submissions.csv](./ios/ICLR-2026-Submissions.csv)**

This CSV file contains the **complete metadata** of all ICLR 2026 submissions retrieved from OpenReview, including **paper titles, authors, affiliations, keywords**, and other public information.

It serves as the **raw data foundation** for generating visual analytics such as the keyword cloud, top-50 frequency chart, and interactive dashboard.

Researchers can reuse this file to perform **custom analyses**, for example: keyword co-occurrence networks, topic evolution studies, or cross-year comparisons across ICLR conferences.

## Input/Output Format

When executed, the fetcher need no input data, and itproduces:

| File | Description |
|------|--------------|
| `ICLR-{year}-Submissions.csv` | Raw metadata of all ICLR 2026 submissions (title, keywords, authors, etc.) |
| `ICLR-{year}-Submissions-Keyword-Cloud.png` | Word cloud visualization of keywords |
| `ICLR-{year}-Submissions-Keyword-Top-50.png` | Bar chart showing top-50 keywords |
| `ICLR-{year}-Submissions-Online.html` | Interactive visualization dashboard |

---

## Insight üí°

These analytics illustrate the evolving **research focus of the AI(ICLR) community**.
In 2026, dominant themes include:

Such analysis helps track emerging paradigms and anticipate future research frontiers.

Beyond topical trends, we also analyze **abstract length** and **submission volume** across research areas.
This enables a preliminary understanding of each field's **competitiveness** and **stylistic tendencies** in abstract writing.
Although this version only accounts for abstract length, the results already hint at characteristic differences between domains.

## Roadmap üî≠

Future versions of *OpenReview Fetcher* will extend support to additional conferences (e.g., NeurIPS, ICML, ACL) and integrate semantic clustering for deeper topic modeling.
