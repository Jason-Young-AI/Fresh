**Miscellaneous** gathers a set of lightweight yet powerful utilities designed to support everyday research workflows with clarity and precision.

---

### Overview âœ¨

Each utility in this section is crafted to:

- Address a **specific research need**: data collection, automation, or transformation and so on.
- Remain **self-contained**: ready to download and run.
- Include **example inputs and outputs**, along with dependency notes for easy reuse.

:::tip
Some Examples (more utilities coming soon):
- **OpenReview Fetcher**: A minimal command-line tool that retrieves and analyzes metadata from OpenReview submissions.
- **Probing Memes**: Rapidly probes multiple large language models across benchmark datasets to detect memotypes and uncover nuanced evaluation insights.

### Purpose ðŸ§­

Though each utility is small in scope, together they form a **research toolkit** that expands the boundaries of creativity and reproducibility.

Every script is made to be easily **copied, extended, or integrated**.
You can think of *Miscellaneous* as the **pen holder** of *Fresh*, always within reach, always ready to create.
