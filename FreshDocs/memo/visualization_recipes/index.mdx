**Visualization** offers a collection of compact, reproducible visualization modules designed to transform raw data into clear, expressive imagery.

> Data gains meaning only when it becomes visible, and visualization is where interpretation begins.

---

## Each Recipe Includes 🍳

- 📜 **Code:** Minimal, reproducible code blocks with defined dependencies, ready to copy and run.
- 🧾 **Example Input Format:** Helps you adapt the visualization to your own data with minimal adjustment.
- 📊 **Example Output Format:** Demonstrates the resulting image or animation generated from the analysis.
- 🧠 **Design Notes:** Explain the motivation behind visual choices, color maps, and mapping strategies.

---

## Purpose 🧭

These examples are not just code snippets, they are **formats of thought**.
Each visualization demonstrates how visualization itself can function as a **thinking device** in the research process, rather than merely as an **illustrative decoration** afterward.

They include, but are not limited to:
- Comparative heatmaps
- Embedding space visualizations
- Temporal transition animations

## 💬 Philosophy

In **Fresh**, visualization should embody both **scientific rigor** and **aesthetic clarity**.  
Each recipe in this volume is written with this spirit, concise, reproducible, and deeply insightful.
