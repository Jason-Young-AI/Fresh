title: Welcome to Fresh
description: Fresh aims to capture and organize the general-purpose practical tools, reusable visualization methods, and other relevant resources involved in daily scientific research activities, facilitating more efficient research workflows.
---

Welcome to **Fresh**, a living archive that collects recurring ideas and reusable modules emerging from everyday research.

---

## Motivation üåø

Every research project produces a stream of tiny yet crucial by-products: snippets of automation, scripts for data collection, or quick visualizations that reveal data distributions.
Yet most of them vanish into private folders, never reaching the visibility they deserve.

**Memo** exists to **preserve** and **circulate** these fragments.
It transforms transient experiments into **reusable, citable, and evolving** knowledge artifacts.

---

## Structure üß©

Memo is organized into several volumes.  
Currently, it includes *Visualization* and *Miscellaneous*, with *Reference*, *Table*, and *Algorithm* volumes planned for the future.


```mdx-code-block

import DocCardList from '@theme/DocCardList';

<DocCardList
  items={[
    {
      type: 'link',
      label: 'Visualization Recipes',
      href: '/memo/visualization_recipes',
      description: 'Minimal, reproducible visual storytelling recipes.'
    },
    {
      type: 'link',
      label: 'Miscellaneous Recipes',
      href: '/memo/miscellaneous_recipes',
      description: 'Lightweight utilities, fetchers, and automation snippets.'
    }
  ]}
/>

```

### Visualization
Code snippets for scientific **visual storytelling**.
These recipes provide minimal, reproducible examples that illustrate how to visualize complex data with clarity and elegance, complete with explicit input/output specifications.

### Miscellaneous
Utilities and helper tools that simplify research workflows.
From data fetchers like *[OpenReview Fetcher](./miscellaneous_recipes/openreview_fetcher)* to lightweight automation scripts and one-off analyses, each entry is self-contained, tested, and easily adaptable for new purposes.

---

## Philosophy üí°

Memo is not a static documentation site but a **living notebook**, where practicality meets reflection.
Each entry is both a **tool** and a **trace of thought**, embodying the **Fresh** vision that research infrastructure and creative process are inseparable.

---

## Contribution & Growth ü§ù

We invite you to:

- fork or adapt existing memos for your own experiments
- expand them into full-scale projects within the Fresh ecosystem
- or simply use them as _seeds_ of inspiration

**Memo grows not by accumulation, but by resonance.**
